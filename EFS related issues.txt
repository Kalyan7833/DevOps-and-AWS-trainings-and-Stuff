apt-get update -y

---------------------------------------------------
EFS:
1)Create 2 instances in two AZ's and Attach a ELB to those .
2)Create a EFS on the same VPC where insatnces are launched.
3)Remember to have same SG across all the instances,EFS,ELB's 
4)Install apache2 or httpd on both instances and remove index.html(if any)
5)Now got to created EFS tab and look for MOUNT DIRECT option and check in that for direct mount command like below which mounts on efs .
  --sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 fs-fb28d0c2.efs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com:/ efs
  --i)sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 fs-fb28d0c2.efs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com:/ /var/www/html
6)Look down for mount related issues.
7)use the above mount cmnd for both the instances to have common EFS for both.
8)now create a index.html file in /var/www/html folder in any one of the instances.
9) You can see the same HTML file in the other instance as both are sharing same EFS. 


EFS mounting issues 
--
to mount EFS files system directly to ubuntu use below cmnds to efs(i) and to any location(ii) like /var/www/html/:
i)sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 fs-fb28d0c2.efs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com:/ efs
                 or 
ii)sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 fs-fb28d0c2.efs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com:/ /var/www/html

if we get any issues like below 
Issue:
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on fs-fb28d0c2.efs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com:/,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
       (for several filesystems (e.g. nfs, cifs) you might
       need a /sbin/mount.<type> helper program)

       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail or so.

Solution:
1) Check to see if package cifs-utils is installed:using ls -l /sbin/mount.cifs
or 
2)This is relevant given that you are trying to mount NFS. The /sbin/mount.nfs helper program is provided by nfs-common.
 You can install it with: sudo apt install nfs-common 

in our case we are mounting nfs4 so install nfs-common package using below cmnd
sudo apt install nfs-common
